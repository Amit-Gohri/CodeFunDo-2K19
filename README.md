SECURE ELECTRONIC VOTING THROUGH AZURE BLOCKCHAIN

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

Elections are a crucial part of a Democratic Country like INDIA and maintaining security is one of the major aspects of the process. We aim to build a web application that allows its users to vote online securely using Microsoft Azure Blockchain. Using blockchain will ensure reliability and transparency in the process.


PROBLEMS

The current system is facing a number of problems such as PROXY voting, use of money and muscle power, booth capturing, tampering of EVMâ€™s, etc. Statistics show the history of low voter turnout. On the other hand, voting from remote locations becomes another major issue also standing in the long queues waiting for their turn becomes frustrating also many voters living in a location other than the constituency s/he is registered are unable to vote.

PROPOSAL

This application will not only help you to vote online by Azure Blockchain and will be able to provide following functionalities -

1. This app will help people to vote online eliminating the long queues..
2. You can vote online even if you are not in the constituency where you are registered as a voter.
3. It will be using azure blockchain and Aadhar database for biometric verification and OTP verification to maintain security.
4. This app will be maintaining a real-time vote record.
5. Applying for online for VOTER ID. (can be integrated with government's NVSP (National Voter Service Portal))

The app will only work on the network provided at the booth because it is not secure to vote from anywhere because someone could be forced to vote for someone else. So it can be made such that the application can only be accessed through the booth stations where through the LAN(Local Area Network). But for the sake of simplicity, a demo will help, we can initially create an application that will run through any network and will be hosted for the time period of elections for particular area/city. Also, the previous working system (voting through EVM) can be integrated with this system (using blockchain technology) to create a blockchain updated by both the systems(EVM and ONLINE). So both voting procedures can run parallely for people who lack the basic technical knowledge to vote online.
